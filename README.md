# Wayfaring

## Description

This project is part of the Frontend Development Bootcamp course challenge for the ninth and tenth week "Mini Project -  Interactive Front-End Application". 

Wayfaring app aims to inspire users with world destinations by providing details about these locations in a easy to view webpage. The app is the place to go to find all the important travel information about a country and its capital city. Every month, a destination of the month is featured on the webpage for traveling inspirations . 

User search history is stored in client-side browser storage. Currency Exchange rate conversions are also stored in local storage too.
